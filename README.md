# Hotel Revenue Insights Dashboard

## Project Objective

The **Hotel Revenue Insights Dashboard** aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of hotel revenue by examining key factors like arrival time, distribution channels, and market segments. The dashboard is designed to give hotel management teams actionable insights into their revenue performance, helping them make informed decisions to optimize revenue streams.

## Dataset Used
<a href= " "></a>

The dataset for this project includes hotel booking data, which consists of the following fields:
- **Arrival Time:** Date of guest arrival (yearly and monthly breakdown).
- **Revenue:** The total revenue generated during each booking.
- **Distribution Channel:** The channel through which the booking was made (e.g., Corporate, Direct, GDS, TA/TO, Undefined).
- **Market Segment:** The segment of the market from which the booking originated (e.g., Aviation, Corporate, Direct, Online TA).
- **Hotel Type:** Indicates whether the hotel is a City Hotel or a Resort Hotel.

## Key Questions

1. How does revenue vary over time (yearly and monthly)?
2. Which distribution channels contribute the most to revenue?
3. Which market segments generate the highest revenue for different types of hotels?
4. How do the revenue trends differ between City Hotels and Resort Hotels?

## KPIs (Key Performance Indicators)

1. **Total Revenue:** The total revenue generated over a specific period (yearly, monthly).
2. **Revenue per Distribution Channel:** Breakdown of revenue by each channel (Corporate, Direct, GDS, TA/TO, Undefined).
3. **Revenue per Market Segment:** Breakdown of revenue by market segment (Aviation, Complementary, Corporate, Direct, Groups, Offline TA/TO, Online TA).
4. **Revenue Comparison by Hotel Type:** Comparison of revenue generated by City Hotels and Resort Hotels.

## Process

1. **Data Collection and Cleaning:** The dataset is collected from the hotel's booking and financial systems. It is cleaned to ensure consistency and accuracy.
2. **Data Analysis:** Revenue is analyzed by arrival time (yearly and monthly), distribution channels, and market segments. Aggregated data is computed to understand the revenue distribution.
3. **Data Visualization:** The data is visualized through interactive charts to provide insights:
   - Line Chart: Revenue vs. Arrival Time (Yearly/Monthly)
   - Bar Chart: Revenue vs. Distribution Channel (Corporate, Direct, GDS, TA/TO, Undefined)
   - Bar Chart: Revenue vs. Market Segment (Aviation, Complementary, Corporate, Direct, Groups, Offline TA/TO, Online TA)
4. **Filtering and Interaction:** The dashboard allows filtering by hotel type (City Hotel or Resort Hotel) to compare revenue trends.

## Insights

1. **Revenue Trends:** The line chart reveals seasonal patterns, showing peak revenue months and trends in both City and Resort Hotels.
2. **Distribution Channel Impact:** The bar chart highlights which channels (e.g., Corporate or Direct) contribute the most to revenue, allowing for better allocation of marketing efforts.
3. **Market Segment Contributions:** The revenue breakdown by market segment helps identify the most profitable segments (e.g., Corporate or Online TA) and the potential for growth in specific areas.
4. **Hotel Type Comparison:** Filtering between City and Resort Hotels provides insights into how each hotel type generates revenue across different distribution channels and market segments.

## Conclusion

The **Hotel Revenue Insights Dashboard** enables hotel management to better understand and optimize their revenue streams. By tracking revenue trends over time, identifying the most profitable distribution channels and market segments, and comparing performance between City and Resort Hotels, the dashboard provides valuable insights for strategic decision-making. With this data-driven approach, hotel operators can maximize their revenue potential and enhance overall business performance.
